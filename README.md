blender models for 3d printing

Pretty simple shapes (dividers and book ends) I designed for a friend to organize his very...very large collection of Magic cards

And one model I made for myself that holds a deck of sleeved playing cards using 2 walls and a slight angle.  If you've ever used fresh sleeves, you know why this is useful.
